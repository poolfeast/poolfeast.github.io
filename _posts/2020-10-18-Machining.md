Just a sample of some of the machining work I've done that was available for me to take photos of.

[![Hammer](/assets/img/Machining Hammer.jpg)](/assets/img/Machining Hammer.jpg)
A soft-blow hammer made by hand, with aluminium heads. Features threading between each component, knurling on the handle, and slight mill use for the fancy hex on the bottom.
Great for separating driveshaft tripods without cracking the brittle steel.
The threads between the steel handle and aluminium shaft have galled, which is good. But the head to shaft thread needed some unholy force to get them to stay attached, some Loctite would probably have worked better.



[![2D SR71](/assets/img/Machining SR71.jpg)](/assets/img/Machining SR71.jpg)
A 2D CNC model, SR-71 modelled in Catia and the toolpath generated in EdgeCAM, you might notice a little bit missing on the nacelles, which was due to machine homing variation. I made the cuts too close to the surface.
It involved four or five tool changes, with the path calculation method, size, and shape of the tool varying for each area of the part, for example using a ball end mill for the sloped sections of the fuselage. I managed to optimise the path enough to get it to 40-something minutes, but still have the fine details visible (like small vents on the engine).

My first CNC part, done with hand-written g-codes. Some of the wood at the pointy sections (tails) was too thin and chipped off. Otherwise it turned out pretty good.
