# Requirements
For RMIT's first entry into the URC we needed a software system that could be implemented quickly, but wouldn't hamper later development with architecture redesigns.

# Summary
Each component inside the Jetson, except for the Command and OS components, functions in a similar environment. With their startup, command input/output and monitoring managed by the central Command component, which has access to the serial link or rover bus.
The system is arranged like this to allow each of the managed components to be isolated, and hence developed independently of the hardware and each other.
To further remove interdependence of components, only native Linux methods of inter-process communication are used. Such as memory mapped files and stdin/stdout. This allows different languages and libraries to be used for each component without anyone having to make allowances in their component for features or libraries that may not be available in other components. 
# Features
## State Storage and Recovery
The components store their state in a particular location on disk with enough detail to allow them to finish a partially completed mission even if the power to the system is interrupted.
The state file(s) is used to convey parameters to the component as well as to store those parameters if the system is interrupted. The file(s) are therefore managed by the command component, which also uses them to infer whether the component should be running or not on boot.
There are two kinds of state that will be stored, state known at startup (probably arguments etc). And state generated by the program as it runs, such as a map of the surroundings. These two should be separated.
## Component Monitoring
The Command component knows if each managed component is supposed to be running or not. And takes actions to restart the process if it exits or is detected to have failed.
If a particular message is not observed in the stdout frequently enough the component will be assumed to have crashed/frozen/hung. (The watchdog message is currently “woof”).
The actions the Command process takes to restart the others are progressive, with some of the components state being deleted if it fails again.
## Forwarding Input and Output
Control of each managed process is done through stdin and stdout (no use for stderr yet), because this mechanism is common to all userspace processes (even on windows I think).
The Command process functions almost as a shell for the ground station, with the purpose of the interface being to allow the state (and settings) of each managed component to be changed, even while they are running, and to allow output (usually debugging text) to be forwarded back to the ground station from a managed component.
Internally there may be some information that needs to be moved from one process to another within the managed environment. It doesn’t really fit very well with the intended purpose of the Command process, but such a thing could easily be done. If the amount of information being exchanged is small. However larger bandwidth connections, such as video, should sort out their own IPC (eg memory mapped files).
## Remote Development
Once the Managed components are working in isolation, testing and development will need to be done using the Jetson itself. This could be difficult for some who are physically far away from the Bundoora lab.
To resolve this, the Jetson will be exposed to the internet so that team members can develop on it remotely. Using a cloud server to maintain a constant connection to the Jetson through the NAT of whatever network it's in. Forwarding connections to servers like SSH, SFTP and some form of remote desktop.
