3D Systems was one of the first 3D printer manufactures. They made large scale multi-extruder printers like the "CubeX" and tried to lock the filament market down with cartridge hardware to ensure you only used the genuine filament.
That didn't work out for them, but after I was given with an old single extruder CubeX I thought it might be worth having a go at modernising it.

The CubeX has a 290x290x300-and-something print volume, with a large, heavy metal carriage with linear bearing on steel rails. It has two NEMA 17 steppers for the Y axis, and one NEMA 23 stepper for the Z.
